# lockbox

The latest brilliant innovation we were able to come up with, was a box, that locks! ðŸ¤¯

This device was meant to be small and cute, and importantly baby friendly. Designed for baby professionals, colloquially known as "Boss Babies" this device is meant to be carried around in a briefcase, unlocked with an RFID badge and four digit pin. In the process we learned a lot about RFID and how encryption worked(when we got sidetracked).

This project started with a schematic:
